Type and Scope of RoU Project Activity: Type Scope 5: Conservation measures taken to recycle and/or
reuse water, spent wash, wastewater etc. across or within
specific industrial processes and systems, including wastewater
recycled/ reused in a different process, but within the same site
or location of the project activity. Recycled wastewater used in
off-site landscaping, gardening or tree plantations/forests
activity are also eligible under this Scope

Overextraction of groundwater for intensive agriculture has led to a critical decline in the water table.
According to the Central Ground Water Board, 79% of Punjab’s blocks are overexploited, leading to
groundwater depletion at an alarming rate of 0.5 meters annually. Climate change exacerbates these
challenges through erratic rainfall patterns and increased evaporation rates, heightening water scarcity
risks.
The wastewater recycling project in Punjab represents a significant step toward addressing the region’s
water security challenges. By treating and reusing wastewater generated from industrial sources, this
project reduces dependency on groundwater, thereby conserving a vital resource under severe stress.

The project integrates advanced treatment technologies, including physico-chemical treatment, MBBR
bioreactors, and membrane filtration systems like ultrafiltration (UF) and reverse osmosis (RO). These
processes effectively eliminate contaminants, ensuring high-quality recycled water suitable for industrial
reuse and non-potable applications such as landscaping and toilet flushing. Additionally, reuse
minimizes the environmental impact of wastewater disposal, reducing pollution in water bodies and
protecting aquatic life. This circular approach significantly reduces the reliance on groundwater, a
precious natural resource. By minimizing the demand for fresh water, the operations of the plant can
contribute to water conservation efforts and alleviate pressure on depleting aquifers.
This project aims to inspire the industry, particularly large multinational corporations, to implement
sustainable water management practices. By demonstrating effective strategies for reducing captive
water consumption and responsibly managing groundwater, the project hopes to foster a broader
adoption of environmentally responsible approaches within the industry.
The wastewater recycle and reuse project aligns closely with several United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs) as it addresses interconnected global challenges by conserving freshwater,
reducing environmental pollution, and enhancing resilience to climate change, which are core tenets of
the SDGs. The ability of the project to integrate environmental, social, and economic benefits ensures
they contribute to the SDG framework’s holistic vision of creating a balanced, inclusive, and sustainable
future for all.

_______________
The project consists of the development of a 1 MLD
wastewater recycling system designed to treat and
reuse effluent efficiently, significantly reducing reliance
on freshwater resources. In the absence of this project
activity, ST COTTEX EXPORTS PRIVATE LIMITED would
have depended on groundwater extraction to meet its
water demands, exacerbating the already critical issue
of water scarcity in India. With urban and industrial
sectors generating over 72,368 million liters of
wastewater daily, only 28% of which is currently
treated2
, the challenge of wastewater management
remains a pressing concern1
. The baseline scenario
involved the discharge of untreated or partially treated
wastewater, leading to groundwater depletion and
environmental pollution. However, through the
advanced treatment processes implemented—
including Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs),
ultrafiltration (UF), and reverse osmosis (RO) systems—the project now ensures the recycling and reuse of water, reducing the dependency on groundwater
and promoting a sustainable water management approach.
